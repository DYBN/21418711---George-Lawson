            <h1>Learning the basics of HTML:</h1>
            <p> Learning HTML and CSS has been straightforward for the most part as lectures from The University of
                Northampton have provided me with personalised tutorials tailored to the module project. These lectures
                combined with outside reading allowed me to successfully make my portfolio website with design features
                that I am satisfied with.
                Reflecting on my experience this module:
                My favourite part of this module was the design process. Although my website could be considered as
                overly vibrant it was enjoyable testing out the animation capabilities of HTML and CSS. Initially I did
                struggle with using grids to layout the website. I managed to overcome this in each iteration I uploaded
                to GitHub allowing for a mobile and desktop view to be both readable and intuitive for the user. If I
                were to improve on this project I would utilise GitHub more effectively. Committing changes and using
                branches helped me keep track of my work and assisted me when writing the report, with more commits and
                more informative comments I feel the report would have been easier to write.

        <p> 10/MAR/23: My initial commit to GitHub was pushed with the basics of a website, the majority of the code
            pushed
            here was placeholder created with the skills learnt from the university lectures. Multiple commits and
            changes
            were made from here including the implementation of an image carousel which is displayed on the Work
            Experience
            page.
        </p>
        <p>16/MAR/23: The focus for me during this time was making the website more coherent. I started with
            finishing the carousel on the Work Experience page and then moved to the portfolio. I implemented fonts
            and edited the class system that I previously implemented. Following on from this I completed the basis
            for the Contact Page along with mobile fixes and visual changes.
        </p>
        <p>17/MAR/23: The most notable changes here include the animated skill bars and centering the contact page.
            Other visual changes were made here and I considered the website to be complete.
        </p>
        <p>26/MAR/23: The finalisation of the project included writing this report, code validation, video explanation and grammatical fixes.
